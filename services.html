<h1 id="BigData">Big Data</h1>
<p>
Every two years, the volume of data in the world doubles, and by 2015, it is estimated that this volume of data will reach 7.9 Zettabytes. Unstructured data, such as text and images account for 90% of this amount. In the future, it is highly anticipated that this massive amount of data i.e. Big Data, will be used in business analytics to improve operations and to offer innovative services.
</p>
<p>
Big Data is very wide in scope and its usage covers a large spectrum of applications from targeted advertisement and recommendation systems, to energy consumption estimation and smart metering.
</p>
<p>
With a wealth of experience in analytics, and a commitment to openness in developing IT infrastructure and tools, along with strong global BI deployment capabilities, PACE IT can help you unlock the business value from your Big Data.
</p>
</div>
<div id="DataAnalytics">
<h1>Data Analytics</h1>
<p>
We have developed an advanced data analytics capability to help our clients extract value from their data. This includes skilled data analysts and statisticians, proprietary and open source analytics toolsets, and a secure data analysis facility to support off-site analysis of our clients’ data for purposes such as customer segmentation or real time risk assessment, to support key functions within our clients’ businesses.
</p>
<p>
Research and development: researching and developing new analytics intellectual property to help solve our clients’ most challenging problems.</p>
<p>
Analytics proof of concept: rapidly demonstrating the business value of analytics techniques in new business areas for our clients. We develop operating models and business cases to support operational implementation of these techniques.
Knowledge transfer: training and supporting our clients to increase their in-house analytics capabilities, with particular focus on the skills base of their data analyst staff.
</p>
</div>
<div id="MobileAppDevelopment">
<h1>Mobile App Development</h1>
<p>
PACE IT design and develop native and web-based mobile apps for iOS (iPhone, iPad & iPod Touch) and Android platforms. Mobile apps can be developed to work standalone or to integrate with an existing web application or website.
</p>
<p>
Native mobile apps deliver content and functionality to users through an intuitive and optimised interface. Building on technology and features which are included in many smartphones allows clients to provide personalised or location based content to their users.
</p>
<p>
Web based apps are a more flexible alternative to a native app which can be compatible with a wider range of smartphones. Typically clients who wish to extend the reach of their existing web application may find it more cost effective to develop a web based app.
</p>
</div>
<div id="CloudComputing">
<h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
<p>
We provide cloud computing services for businesses and organisations eliminating expensive software, hardware and network upgrade costs while giving you total accessability from ANY device anywhere.
</p>
<p>
Cloud computing saves you time, money and space making better use of your hardware and software by replacing your traditional local IT network with a series of services delivered to you over the Internet.
</p>
<p>
Migrating your IT infrastructure, applications and software to "the cloud" is the next obvious step in IT service provision as organisations look to reduce costs, environmental impact and improve overall efficiency.
</p>
</div>

<div id="BusinessIntelligence">
<h1>Business Intelligence</h1>
<p>
We recognise that successful business intelligence (BI) can only be achieved through collaboration between the business and its technology suppliers.
</p>
<p>
We believe that a traditional waterfall approach, a sequential design process, is not best suited to BI development. Users need to see, query and report on the data in order to approve requirements and validate design.
</p>
<p>
Our developing BI requirements service enables us to work with our clients to iteratively develop prototypes quickly and then build a robust and lasting set of requirements that all parties understand and approve of.
</p>
<p>The prototypes are developed within a controlled environment for a set of key users (the 'model office'). This prototyping provides the flexibility to develop new and emerging requirements in short succession allowing users to understand how these will work in practice.
</p>
<p>Once all the requirements are identified and proven in the prototyping stage, we move to a more traditional sequential development lifecycle.</p>
</div>
<div id="CRMSolutions">

</p>
</div>
<div id="EnterpriseApplications">
<h1>Enterprise Applications</h1>
<p>
Module Developers Are Not Enough!</p>
<p>
It is no longer enough to have developers build web sites and custom modules. Building anything without the right overall business strategy will never achieve the full business value you need.
